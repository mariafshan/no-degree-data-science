# Lesson Learning Objectives

## Exploring Numerical Data
**Suggested reading:** [OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=os "OpenIntro Statistics"), 3rd edition, Chapter 1, Section 1.6

**LO 1.** Use scatterplots for describing the relationship between two numerical variables making sure to note the direction (positive or negative), form (linear or non-linear) and the strength of the relationship as well as any unusual observations that stand out. 

**LO 2.** When describing the distribution of a numerical variable, mention its shape, center, and spread, as well as any unusual observations. 

**LO 3.** Note that there are three commonly used measures of center and spread:
- center: mean (the arithmetic average), median (the midpoint), mode (the most frequent observation).
- spread: standard deviation (variability around the mean), range (max-min), interquartile range (middle 50% of the distribution).

**LO 4.** Identify the shape of a distribution as symmetric, right skewed, or left skewed, and unimodal, bimodal, multimodal, or uniform. 

**LO 5.** Use histograms and box plots to visualize the shape, center, and spread of numerical distributions, and intensity maps for visualizing the spatial distribution of the data. 

**LO 6.** Define a robust statistic (e.g. median, IQR) as a statistic that is not heavily affected by skewness and extreme outliers, and determine when such statistics are more appropriate measures of center and spread compared to other similar statistics. 

**LO 7.** Recognize when transformations (e.g. log) can make the distribution of data more symmetric, and hence easier to model. 

***Test yourself:***

*1. Describe what is meant by robust statistics and when they are used.*

*2. Describe when and why we might want to apply a log transformation to a variable.*

## Exploring Categorical Data and Introduction to Inference
Suggested reading: [OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=os "OpenIntro Statistics"), 3rd edition, Chapter 1, Sections 1.7 - 1.8

**LO 1.** Use frequency tables and bar plots to describe the distribution of one categorical variable. 

**LO 2.** Use contingency tables and segmented bar plots or mosaic plots to assess the relationship between two categorical variables. 

**LO 3.** Use side-by-side box plots for assessing the relationship between a numerical and a categorical variable. 

***Test yourself:***

*1. Interpret the plot in Figure 1.30 of OpenIntro Statistics (page 39).*

*2. You collect data on 100 classmates, 70 females and 30 males. 10% of the class are smokers, and smoking is independent of gender. Calculate how many males and females would be expected to be smokers. Sketch a mosaic plot of this scenario.*
