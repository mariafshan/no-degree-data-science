# 1.1. What is Data Science?

#### Shingai Manjengwa, CEO, Fireside Analytics Inc.
> Data Science is a process, not an event. It is the process of using data to understand different things, to understand the world. 

#### Rafael B. Da Silva
>For me is when you have a model or hypothesis of a problem, and you try to validate that hypothesis or model with your data.

#### Diana Zarate Diaz
> Data science is the art of uncovering the insights and trends that are hiding behind data.

#### Luis O. Martins
> It's when you translate data into a story. So use storytelling to generate insight. And with these insights, you can make strategic choices for a company or an institution.

#### Mandeep Kaur
> Data science is a field about processes and systems to extract data from various forms of whether it is unstructured or structured form.

#### Stephen Sherman
> Data science is the study of data. Like biological sciences is a study of biology, physical sciences, it's the study of physical reactions. Data is real, data has real properties, and we need to study them if we're going to work on them.

#### Murtaza Haider, PhD, Associate Professor, Ted Rogers School of Management
> Data Science involves data and some science. The definition or the name came up in the 80s and 90s when some professors were looking into the statistics curriculum, and they thought it would be better to call it data science. But what is Data Science? I'd see data science as one's attempt to work with data, to find answers to questions that they are exploring. In a nutshell, it's more about data than it is about science. If you have data, and you have curiosity, and you're working with data, and you're manipulating it, you're exploring it, the very exercise of going through analyzing data, trying to get some answers from it is data science. Data science is relevant today because we have tons of data available. We used to worry about lack of data. Now we have a data deluge. In the past, we didn't have algorithms, now we have algorithms. In the past, the software was expensive, now it's open source and free. In the past, we couldn't store large amounts of data, now for a fraction of the cost, we can have gazillions of datasets for a very low cost. So, the tools to work with data, the very availability of data, and the ability to store and analyze data, it's all cheap, it's all available, it's all ubiquitous, it's here. There's never been a better time to be a data scientist.

Data science is the field of exploring, manipulating, and analyzing data, and using data to answer questions or make recommendations.

Although the different data scientists interviewed in the video gave what seemed like different answers, they all agreed that data science involved using data to answer questions or make recommendations.

# 1.2. Fundamentals of Data Science
https://www.coursera.org/learn/what-is-datascience/lecture/tPgFU/fundamentals-of-data-scienceFundamentals

Data Science has a significant **data analysis** component.

Data analysis isn't new.

What is new is the vast quantity of data available from massively varied sources:
1. Log files
2. E-mail
3. Social media
4. Sales data
5. Patient information files
6. Sports performance data
7. Sensor data
8. Security cameras

At the same time that there is more data available than ever, we have the computing power needed to make a useful analysis and reveal new knowledge.

Data science can help organizations:
1. Understand their environments
2. Analyze existing issues
3. Reveal previously hidden opportunities

![](1-2-1.jpg)

Data scientists use data analysis to add to the **knowledge** of the organization by investigating data, exploring the best way to use it to provide **value** to the business.

### The process of data science:
First step: defines how the **data science project** progresses.
1. Focus on a specific problem
2. Clarify the question that the organization wants answered.

Good data scientists are curious people who **ask questions** to clarify the business need.
#### What data do we need to solve the problem, and where will that data come from?
1. Structured
2. Unstructured data

Using multiple models to explore the data reveals:
1. Patterns
2. Archetypes
3. Outliers

Sometimes, this will confirm what the organization **suspects**, but sometimes it will be completely **new knowledge**, leading the organization to a **new approach**.


When the data has revealed its **insights**, the role of the data scientist becomes that of a **storyteller**, **communicating** the results to the project stakeholders.

#### Data visualization tools
Help stakeholders understand:
1. The nature of the results
2. Recommended action to take

#### Data Science is changing:
1. The way we work
2. The way we use data
3. Our approach to the world
4. The way organisations understand the world.

> Data science didn't really exist when I was growing up. It's not something that I ever woke up and said, I want to be a data scientist when I grow up. No, it didn't exist. I didn't know I would be working in data science.

> My undergraduate degree was in business, and I majored in politics, philosophy, and economics and then I did a masters in business analytics at New York University at
the Stern School of Business. When I left my undergrad,
the first company I joined, it turned out that they were analyzing electronic point of sale data for retail manufacturers and what we were doing was data science. But we only really started using that term much later. In fact, I'd say four or five years ago is when we started calling it analytics and data science.

#### Rafael B. Da Silva
> When I grew up, there isn't that field called data science. And I think it's really new.

> I had a complicated problem that I needed to solve, and the usual techniques that we had at that time couldn't help with that problem.

#### Stephen Sherman
> Data science didn't exist until 2009, 2011. Someone like DJ Patil or Andrew Gelman coined the term. Before that, there was statistics and I didn't want to be any of those. I want to be in business and then I found data science a heck of a lot more interesting.

> I graduated with a math degree in the worst possible time, right after the economic crisis, and you actually had to be useful to get a job. So I went and got a degree in statistics and then I worked enough jobs that were called data scientist that I suddenly became one.

#### Diana Zarate Diaz
> I studied statistics, that's how I started. I went through many different stages in my life where I wanted to be a singer and then a doctor. And then I realized that I was good at math. So, I chose an area that was
focused on quantitative analysis and from then I do think that I wanted to work with data. Not necessarily data science as it's known today.

#### Luis O. Martins
> The first time that I had contact with data science, when I was my first year as a mechanical engineering and strategic consulting firms, they use data science to make decisions. So, it was my first contact with data science.

> I had several options for my internship here in Canada and one of the options was to work with data science. I used to work with project development but I think that was a good choice and then I start my
internship with data science. 

#### Murtaza Haider, PhD, Associate Professor, Ted Rogers School of Management
> I'm a civil engineer by training, so all engineers work with data. I would say the conventional use of data science in my life started with transportation research. I started building large models trying to forecast traffic on streets, trying to determine congestion and greenhouse gas emissions or tailpipe emissions. So I think that's where my start was and I started building these models when I was a graduate student at the University of Toronto. Started working with very large data sets, looking at household samples of, say, 150,000 households from half a million trips and that, too, I'm speaking from mid 90s when this was supposed to be a very large data set, but not in today's terms. But that's how I started. I continued working with it. And then I moved to McGill University where I was a professor of transportation engineering and I built even bigger data models that involved data and analytics and so I would say, yes, transportation research brought me to data science.

As data science is not a discipline traditionally taught at universities, contemporary data scientists come from diverse backgrounds such as engineering, statistics, and physics.

This is correct. Contemporary data scientists come from different backgrounds such as engineering, mathematics, and even psychology. The secret skill is passion for continuous learning of new tools and patience to clean and analyze data.
