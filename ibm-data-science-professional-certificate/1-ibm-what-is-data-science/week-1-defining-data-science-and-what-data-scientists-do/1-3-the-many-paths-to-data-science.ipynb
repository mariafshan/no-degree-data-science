    "> Data science didn't really exist when I was growing up. It's not something that I ever woke up and said, I want to be a data scientist when I grow up. No, it didn't exist. I didn't know I would be working in data science.\n",

    "the first company I joined, it turned out that they were analyzing electronic point of sale data for retail manufacturers and what we were doing was data science. But we only really started using that term much later. In fact, I'd say four or five years ago is when we started calling it analytics and data science.\n",

    "> Data science didn't exist until 2009, 2011. Someone like DJ Patil or Andrew Gelman coined the term. Before that, there was statistics and I didn't want to be any of those. I want to be in business and then I found data science a heck of a lot more interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "> I graduated with a math degree in the worst possible time, right after the economic crisis, and you actually had to be useful to get a job. So I went and got a degree in statistics and then I worked enough jobs that were called data scientist that I suddenly became one.\n",

    "> The first time that I had contact with data science, when I was my first year as a mechanical engineering and strategic consulting firms, they use data science to make decisions. So, it was my first contact with data science.\n",

    "#### Murtaza Haider, PhD, Associate Professor, Ted Rogers School of Management\n",
    "> I'm a civil engineer by training, so all engineers work with data. I would say the conventional use of data science in my life started with transportation research. I started building large models trying to forecast traffic on streets, trying to determine congestion and greenhouse gas emissions or tailpipe emissions. So I think that's where my start was and I started building these models when I was a graduate student at the University of Toronto. Started working with very large data sets, looking at household samples of, say, 150,000 households from half a million trips and that, too, I'm speaking from mid 90s when this was supposed to be a very large data set, but not in today's terms. But that's how I started. I continued working with it. And then I moved to McGill University where I was a professor of transportation engineering and I built even bigger data models that involved data and analytics and so I would say, yes, transportation research brought me to data science.\n",

    "As data science is not a discipline traditionally taught at universities, contemporary data scientists come from diverse backgrounds such as engineering, statistics, and physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is correct. Contemporary data scientists come from different backgrounds such as engineering, mathematics, and even psychology. The secret skill is passion for continuous learning of new tools and patience to clean and analyze data."
