https://www.coursera.org/learn/what-is-datascience/home/week/2

In this module, you will hear from Norman White, the Faculty Director of the Stern Centre for Research Computing at New York University, as he talks about data science and the skills required for anyone interested in pursuing a career in this field. He also advises those looking to start a career in data science. Finally, you will complete reading assignments to learn about the process of mining a given dataset and about regression analysis.

### Learning Objectives
1. Define Big Data and its distinguishing characteristics, such as, Velocity, Volume, Veracity, and Value.
2. Describe how Hadoop and other big data tools, combined with distributed computing power, are triggering digital transformation.
3. List some of the skills required to be a data scientist and analyze big data.
4. Explain what data mining is and the steps required to mine a given a dataset.
5. Explain the difference between common data science terms, including deep learning and machine learning.
6. Describe regression and some of its applications.
7. Describe how to apply the Data Understanding and Data Preparation stages of the methodology to a data science problem.

In this lesson, you have learned:
1. Data science is the study of large quantities of data, which can reveal insights that help organizations make strategic choices.
2. There are  many paths to a career in data science; most, but not all, involve a little math, a little science, and a lot of curiosity about data.
3. New data scientists need to be curious, judgemental and argumentative.
4. Why data science is considered the sexiest job in the 21st century, paying high salaries for skilled workers.
5. The typical work day for a Data Scientist varies depending on what type of project they are working on.
6. Many algorithms are used to bring out insights from data. 
7. Accessing algorithms, tools, and data through the Cloud enables Data Scientists to stay up-to-date and collaborate easily.
