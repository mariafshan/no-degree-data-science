# Data Science in Business

# 3.1. How Data Science is saving lives
https://www.coursera.org/learn/what-is-datascience/lecture/RvMe9/how-data-science-is-saving-lives

Using Data Science techniques to understand and analyze the large data sets available today has a huge impact on human lives. It can provide targeted information to help healthcare professionals give the best treatment to patients, or help predict natural disasters so that people can prepare early, and much more besides.

## Data Science in Healthcare
![](3-1-1.jpg)

In healthcare, data scientists use predictive analytics developed from data mining, data modeling, statistics, and machine learning to find the best options for patients.

![](3-1-2.jpg)

This type of predictive analytics examines all known factors for a disease, including gene markers, associated conditions, and environmental factors.

![](3-1-3.jpg)

It then recommends appropriate tests, suitable trials, and any suggested treatments.

Every individual physician has their own store of knowledge gained from their studies, interests, and experiences. Data science systems that use predictive analytics ensure that all physicians can also access the latest information about the disease, tests, and treatment plans, tailored to their specific patient.

With this type of system, every physician has access to the same knowledge, and the best options can be consistently offered, improving patient outcomes. For example, a study by the Boston Consulting Group and AdvaMedDx, an industry association of medical diagnostics companies, examined the barriers to the adoption of potentially lifesaving diagnostic tests for patients with a specific cancer and a particular gene marker.

The study discovered that the biggest factor in the patient being offered a specific test was the patientâ€™s oncologist, who may or may not have known about the test and its relationship to the gene marker. By providing extra information through data science tools, physicians can be made aware of the most helpful tests and treatments for a specific patient.

## Data Mining
There are many opportunities to explore other ways to mine data, such as from electronic medical records for different types of medical research. Schools such as the NorthShore University HealthSystem in suburban Chicago, a leader in the implementation of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems, now offer guidance on data mining.

It is the first healthcare provider in America to be awarded the highest level of EMR deployment for both inpatient and outpatient care. This remarkable effort has generated much-anonymized data available for innovative analytics research.

Developing more sophisticated big data analytics capabilities helps healthcare organizations move from basic descriptive analytics towards predictive insights, thanks to data science.

## Disaster Preparedness
In the field of Disaster Preparedness, the ability to save lives using Data Science tools has been under development for many years. The use of predictive analytics tools is improving and providing new data analysis in a multitude of ways, alerting populations to danger faster than ever before.

Large, high-quality data sets can be used to predict the occurrence of numerous types of natural disasters, which can be the difference between life and death for thousands of people. Earthquakes, hurricanes & tornados, floods, and volcanic eruptions can be predicted with the help of data science.

Recent research at the University of Warwick in the UK used social media content such as photos and keywords to track the development of floods, hurricanes and other weather events. When added to the information recorded by scientists and weather stations, this type of data can be used to improve the predictions for localised weather events.

Because the real benefit of this knowledge is so important, schools are starting to include this type of data science education in their curriculum. For instance, the University of Chicago Graham School offers a Master of Science course in Threat and Response Management.

Data science tools enable organizations to analyse vast quantities of data from widely different sources, and present that information in a way that allows data scientists to gain new knowledge, in some cases, saving hundreds of lives.

# 3.2. How Should Companies Get Started in Data Science?
https://www.coursera.org/learn/what-is-datascience/lecture/AAArc/how-should-companies-get-started-in-data-science

Some of the first steps that companies need to take to get started in data science:
1. Start collecting data - Without data, no data science work can be carried out
2. Put together a team of data scientists - You need competent data scientists who would use the data to help you make data-driven decisions

## Murtaza Haider, PhD, Associate Professor, Ted Rogers School of Management
> At the end of the day, for businesses, they know one thing, that if they are unable to measure something, they are unable to improve it. And if they are unable to measure their costs, they are unable to reduce them. If they're unable to measure their profits, they are unable to increase them. So the first thing a company has to do is to start recording information, start capturing data, data about costs. And the differentiate it by labor costs and material cost, the cost to how much it cost to sell one product and the total cost. And then you look at the revenue, where's your revenue coming from? Is 80% of your revenue coming from 20% of your customers? Or is it the other way around?

> So first thing first, start capturing data. Once you have data, then you can apply algorithms and analytics to it. So the first thing to do would be to capture data. If you're not capturing it, start capturing it. If you're capturing it, archive it. Do not overwrite on your old data thinking you don't need it anymore. Data never gets old. Data is always relevant, even if it's 100 years old, 200 years old. It is relevant to you and and your firm and your success. So keep data, capture it, archive it, make sure nothing goes to waste. Make sure there's a consistency. So someone 20 years later trying to understand, that data should be able to do so, so have proper documentation. Do it now. Put the best practices for data archiving in place the moment you start a business. And if you're already in business and you haven't done it, do it now.

## Stephen Sherman
> Start measuring things. Too many companies haven't measured things properly for a decade and, then they decide, they want data science. Data science inside a company is only going to be as valuable as the data collected. Garbage in, garbage out is a rule in any sort of analysis.

## Shingai Manjengwa, CEO, Fireside Analytics Inc.
> If something is not measured, it's very difficult to improve it or to change it. So the very first step is measurement. If companies have existing data, then they should start looking at it and cleaning it. If they don't have existing data, then they need to start collecting it.

## Mandeep Kaur
> I think to look for a team who love to work as a data scientist.

## Luis O. Martins
> The first stop is to have employees, that they are interested on data science. because if you don't have interest in your company, you will not have engagement.

## Diana Zarate Diaz
> Companies should remember, that it's key to have a team. So it's not one data scientist, but a team of them, that each of them have strengths in different areas of data science.

# 3.3. Applications of Data Science
https://www.coursera.org/learn/what-is-datascience/lecture/bpXlb/applications-of-data-science

Data science and big data are making an undeniable impact on businesses, changing day-to-day operations, financial analytics, and especially interactions with customers.

It's clear that businesses can gain enormous value from the insights data science can provide. But sometimes it's hard to see exactly how.

In this era of big data, almost everyone generates masses of data every day, often without being aware of it. This digital trace reveals the patterns of our online lives.

If you have ever searched for or bought a product on a site like Amazon, you'll notice that it starts making recommendations related to your search. This type of system known as a **recommendation engine** is a common application of data science.

Companies like Amazon, Netflix, and Spotify use algorithms to make specific recommendations derived from customer preferences and historical behavior. Personal assistants like Siri on Apple devices use data science to devise answers to the infinite number of questions end users may ask.

Google watches your every move in the world, you're online shopping habits, and your social media. Then it analyzes that data to create recommendations for restaurants, bars, shops, and other attractions based on the data collected from your device and your current location.

Wearable devices like Fitbits, Apple watches, and Android watches add information about your activity levels, sleep patterns, and heart rate to the data you generate.

## Business Impact
Now that we know how consumers generate data, let's take a look at how data science is impacting business. In 2011, McKinsey & Company said that data science was going to become the key basis of competition. Supporting new waves of productivity, growth, and innovation.

In 2013, UPS announced that it was using data from customers, drivers, and vehicles, in a new route guidance system aimed to save time, money, and fuel. Initiatives like this support the statement that data science will fundamentally change the way businesses compete and operate.

#### How does a firm gain a competitive advantage?

Netflix collects and analyzes massive amounts of data from millions of users, including which shows people are watching at what time a day when people pause, rewind, and fast-forward, and which shows directors and actors they search for.

Netflix can be confident that a show will be a hit before filming even begins by analyzing users preference for certain directors and acting talent, and discovering which combinations people enjoy. Add this to the success of earlier versions of a show and you have a hit.

For example, Netflix knew many of its users had streamed to the work of David Fincher. They also knew that films featuring Robin Wright had always done well, and that the British version of House of Cards was very successful.

Netflix knew that significant numbers of people who liked Fincher also liked Wright. All this information combined to suggest that buying the series would be a good investment for the company. They were right. It was a huge hit. Thanks to data science, Netflix knows what people want before they do.

# 3.4. The Final Deliverable
https://www.coursera.org/learn/what-is-datascience/ungradedWidget/R3KYL/the-final-deliverable

Prescribed Reading: Chapter 3 Pg. 52-53

## The Final Deliverable
The ultimate purpose of analytics is to communicate findings to the concerned who might use these insights to formulate policy or strategy. Analytics summarize findings in tables and plots. The data scientist should then use the insights to build the narrative to communicate the findings. In academia, the final deliverable is in the form of essays and reports. Such deliverables are usually 1,000 to 7,000 words in length. In consulting and business, the final deliverable takes on several forms. It can be a small document of fewer than 1,500 words illustrated with tables and plots, or it could be a comprehensive document comprising several hundred pages. Large consulting firms, such as McKinsey and Deloitte,I routinely generate analytics-driven reports to communicate their findings and, in the process, establish their expertise in specific knowledge domains.

Let's review the "United States Economic Forecast", a publication by the Deloitte University Press. This document serves as a good example for a deliverable that builds narrative from data and analytics. The 24-page report focuses on the state of the U.S. economy as observed in December 2014. The report opens with a **grabber** highlighting the fact that contrary to popular perception, the economic and job growth has been quite robust in the United States. The report is not merely a statement of facts.

In fact, it is a carefully crafted report that cites Voltaire and follows a distinct theme. The report focuses on the **good news** about the U.S. economy. These include the increased investment in manufacturing equipment in the U.S. and the likelihood of higher consumer consumption resulting from lower oil prices.

The Deloitte report uses time series plots to illustrate trends in markets. The GDP growth chart shows how the economy contracted during the Great Recession and has rebounded since then. The graphic presents four likely scenarios for the future. Another plot shows the changes in consumer spending. The accompanying narrative focuses on income inequality in the U.S. and refers to Thomas Pikkety's book on the same. The Deloitte report mentions many consumers did not experience an increase in their real incomes over the years, while they still maintained their level of spending. Other graphics focused on housing, business, and government sectors, international trade, labor, and financial markets, and prices. The appendix carries four tables documenting data for the four scenarios discussed in the report.

Deloitte's "United States Economic Forecast" serves the very purpose that its authors intended. The report uses data and analytics to generate the likely economic scenarios. It builds a powerful narrative in support of the thesis statement that the U.S. economy is doing much better than most would like to believe. At the same time, the report shows Deloitte to be a competent firm capable of analyzing economic data and prescribing strategies to cope with the economic challenges.

Now consider if we were to exclude the narrative from this report and presented the findings as a deck of PowerPoint slides with eight graphics and four tables. The PowerPoint slides would have failed to communicate the message that the authors carefully crafted in the report citing Piketty and Voltaire. I consider Deloitte's report a good example of storytelling with data and encourage you to read the report to decide for yourself whether the deliverable would have been equally powerful without the narrative.

Now, let us work backward from the Deloitte report. Before the authors started their analysis, they must have discussed the scope of the final deliverable. They would have deliberated the key message of the report and then looked for the data and analytics they needed to make their case. The initial planning and conceptualizing of the final deliverable is therefore extremely important for producing a compelling document. Embarking on analytics, without due consideration to the final deliverable, is likely to result in a poor-quality document where the analytics and narrative would struggle to blend.

# Careers and Recruiting in Data Science

# 3.5. How Can Someone Become a Data Scientist?
https://www.coursera.org/learn/what-is-datascience/lecture/Y1WAm/how-can-someone-become-a-data-scientist

## Norman White, Clinical Professor of CMS, Faculty Director, Research Computing, New York University, Stern

According to Dr. White, if someone is coming into a data science team, the first skills they would need are:
1. Understanding relational databases.
2. Knowing some algebra and some calculus.
3. Knowing how to program, at least have some computational thinking.
4. Knowing basic probability and some basic statistics.

> A real data scientist, the high-end data scientists, are mostly PhDs. They often come out of physics, out of statistics, they have to have a computer science background, they have to have a math background, they have to know about databases and statistics and probability and all that stuff.

> However, if you're coming into a data science team, I think the first skills you need is you need to know how to program, at least have some computational thinking, so having taken a programming course, you need to know some algebra, at least up to analytics, geometry, and hopefully some calculus, some basic probability, some basic statistics, I mean really have to understand the different statistical distributions, and database.

> I mean, one of the easiest places to start is relational databases, which stores lots and lots of our data so people can first walk before they can run by at least understanding about computers and databases and how we store things and if you understand relational databases nowadays you can still, just with that understanding, use big data clusters as if they were just a big relational database. You don't have to really have
understand the whole MapReduce programming model.

> But then, as you go further up in the field, then you have to know a lot of computer science theory and statistics, it's really, and probability, it's really the intersection of them that the high end data scientists, the PhD data scientists work with.

#### What is the role of self-learning in data science?
> I do a lot of self-learning. I think everybody these days, I mean, I learned about Hadoop all by myself, I read some articles, I watched some videos, I thought, I played, although I'm a builder, I'm a tinkerer, so if I wanna figure out how to do something, I build it. I mean, my first HPC cluster I heard about this term a Beowulf cluster, I mean, yeah, what the hell's that? So I looked it up and said, oh, it's just a bunch of computers hooked together with a TCP/ IP network, that's pretty easy, so we get a grant from Citi Bank and we built a five thing cluster and I said, oh, well, that's HPC. I said, I had one of the first HPC clusters at the university, it was tiny but a lot of our researchers loved it because they could run stuff 40 and 50 times faster.

> So I think one of the ways you learn things is you do them, you have to do them, and these online learning platforms especially now that we have things like IPython and Jupyter Notebooks and I guess Zeppelin means that you can actually go in and take some of these courses and you can do things right then and you can see them and feel them and play with them and, at that point, you know, you'll start to get your head around what is actually happening.

> Motivation is the key problem in all of these, is how to keep people motivated and I think the badge system that the, what was it, Big Data University has, is one of the ways is how do you get people to keep going through. But if they want to, they can. It's up to the individual to. So they have to understand what the goal is.

#### Where should data science fit in the organizational structure?
> The place it can't sit is probably under the CIO, the Chief Information Officer. CIOs current chief information officers in many companies got there from an accounting background or a finance background, they're clueless. Sorry. But they really, it has to come out of the research side.

> So you'll find data scientists primarily in companies that have some research agenda, pharmaceuticals, finance, all of, any technology company. If you look at, we can't keep some of our PhD data scientists in our program, they are now at Facebook, they're at Linkedin, they're at Uber, they're at Lyft, because the demand out there for the PhD level data scientist is just unbelievable. They make large amounts of money and they're playing with problems that are really, really neat. How do you schedule the Uber cars? You have enormous amounts of data.
