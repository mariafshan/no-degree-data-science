# No Degree Data Science
I have a bachelors with honours in Finance Accounting and Management with experiences as external auditor and tax accountant in accounting firms. Inspired by [David Venturi's No Degree Data Science Master's](https://davidventuri.com/blog/my-data-science-masters "David Venturi's No Degree Data Science Master's"), I decided to currate my own curriculum. Reasons being everyone began  and so I want to personalize my own journey.

If you find my learning repo useful, then welcome.

### Learning Goals
This repo was not created with an ambition to replace an actual degree. My goals are therefore of the following:
1. Learn the foundational knowledge necessary for Data Science.
2. Learn practical skills demanded by the job market.
3. Build projects.

All with super low to no cost from online resources.

### Prerequisites
I built this curriculum using myself an anchor (non-STEM background, b-school graduate, accountant).

*However, regardless of which stage you are in life, I highly recommend you read the following: "is [Computer Science/ Data Science/ etc] the right career choice for me?"*
